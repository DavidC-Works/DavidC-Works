# Hi, I'm David — an Aspiring R&D Engineer

I'm building a foundation across computer science, electrical and computer engineering, and embedded systems with the long-term goal of working in research and development. My interest is in understanding how software, hardware, and systems fit together so I can design and build reliable, end-to-end solutions.

GitHub is where I keep the projects that support that path — academic work from my CS degree, engineering experiments, embedded development, personal tools, and early steps into broader engineering disciplines. I organize things clearly so visitors can explore and evaluate my work based on the projects themselves.

## What You'll Find Here
- Hands-on engineering and embedded projects  
- Academic coursework and software projects from my CS degree  
- Tools, utilities, and personal builds  
- Experiments as I learn ECE fundamentals and hardware concepts  

I use a simple prefix system to keep everything organized:  
- **ENG-** engineering and embedded systems projects  
- **PRO-** professional materials and career development  
- **PER-** personal tools and creations  
- **ACA-** academic coursework

## Outside of Engineering
I try to keep balance alongside my technical work. A few things that matter to me outside of code and electronics:

- I played college baseball and still enjoy staying physically active  
- I like photography, media creation, and want to get back into art (like WLOP)
- I enjoy gaming, though much less frequently since starting college  
- I want to travel more and broaden my experiences outside academics
